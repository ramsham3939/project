    <h1 style="text-align:center">Robotics, AI & Machine Learning</h1>
    <br><br>

    Artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics are two closely related fields that are transforming the way we live
    and work.

    AI involves the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that normally require human
    intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. These tasks are achieved through the use
    of algorithms and machine learning techniques that allow computers to analyze and interpret data, and make
    decisions based on that data.

    Robotics, on the other hand, involves the design and development of robots, which are mechanical or
    electromechanical devices that can be programmed to perform a variety of tasks. Robots can be used in a
    variety of settings, including manufacturing, healthcare, and transportation, to perform tasks that are either
    too dangerous, too repetitive, or too complex for humans to perform.

    AI and robotics are revolutionizing many industries and have the potential to transform the way we live and
    work. For example, AI-powered virtual assistants and chatbots are being used to improve customer service,
    while AI-powered robots are being used in manufacturing and healthcare to improve efficiency and accuracy. In
    transportation, self-driving vehicles are being developed that use AI to navigate roads and make decisions
    about how to safely reach their destination.

    However, the rapid advancement of AI and robotics also raises ethical concerns, such as the potential for job
    displacement and the need for proper regulation to ensure the safe and responsible use of these technologies.
    These issues will need to be carefully considered as AI and robotics continue to advance and become more
    prevalent in society.

    Overall, AI and robotics are exciting and rapidly evolving fields that have the potential to transform many
    aspects of our lives. They offer exciting new possibilities and challenges, and will continue to shape the
    future in ways that are difficult to predict.
    <br><br>
    Robotics involves the creation of robots to perform tasks without further intervention, while AI is how systems
    emulate the human mind to make decisions and ‘learn.’

    While you can have robotics with an AI element (and vice versa), both can, and usually do, exist independently of
    each other.

    For most robots, designed to perform simple, repetitive tasks, there’s no need for advanced AI as the duties are
    simple, predictable and pre-programmed.

    But many such AI-free robotics systems were created with past limitations of artificial intelligence in mind, and as
    the technology continues to advance in leaps and bounds each year, robotics manufacturers may feel increasingly
    confident in pushing the limits in what can be achieved by marrying the two disciplines.

    The cited examples of AI in manufacturing, aerospace, healthcare and agriculture highlighted above can certainly
    leave us feeling confident that the future is bright for robotics and artificial intelligence.
    <br><br>

    It is a well-recognized fact that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotics have been gaining a gigantic
    collaboration around the globe for several kinds of purposes. The escalating demand and prominence of the robotic
    have made life extremely easy. However, simultaneously an overly concerned hostility arises for human beings as the
    robots are taking over all the jobs in the industrial world. Robots are bringing about productivity while at the
    same time lessening the employment opportunities. Robots have already taken over all the blue-collar jobs. Now
    robots have started to enter white-collar jobs as well. As a result, jobs in all areas will be at stake. Robots,
    artificial friends, can perform low paid hard jobs in unsocial hours, generating a tremendous amount of comfort for
    the world. There is a high possibility that future generations will see robots as teachers and carers as soon as the
    robots are successfully learning feelings like compassion and complex response sensing. Robots perform jobs with
    faster speed as studies suggest that one robot functions similarly to 70 full-time human workers [1]. The rise in
    robotic adoption results in falling into employment opportunities [2]. However, the next generations can only be
    able to achieve the fundamental advances of the robots after investing in this field for years[3].

    We have done a systematic analysis of various kinds of robots by utilizing the comparison parameters to demonstrate
    the fundamental objective of the development of the robots. The main objective of our research is to expose the
    consequences of the robotics on human employment opportunities in all the areas. We have also discussed the future
    of the human and robot relationship.

    Advantages of automation and intelligent machines
    • Predominantly in the industries of developed countries (countries with high labor costs), automation and the use
    of production robots cause significant savings concerning the cost of labor and products. A production robot might
    thus cost cheaper than a worker in China. Another characteristic is that robots do not fall sick, have children or
    go on strikes and are not entitled to annual leaves.

    • An intelligent machine need not rely on external components and can work unfailingly and continuously 24/7, and it
    can work in danger zones. As an implication, its accuracy is greater than that of a human, and it cannot be
    side-tracked either by fatigue or by other external circumstances.

    • While making crucial decisions, intelligent systems can be governed by unprejudiced standards so that decisions
    can be made practically, based on facts and data. Productivity expansions have so far always led to an upgrading of
    living circumstances for everybody. The same applies to intelligent machines.

    • The significant advantage for employees is that the burden of labor-intensive may reduce for them; tedious, dull
    work can be done via self-ruling frameworks. The same is appropriate for typical back-end activities in the service
    sector: frameworks can be designed to gather information naturally, transfer data from one system to another, and
    find resolutions for problems. Once an interface between two systems is set up, manual intervention to enter data is
    not necessary.

    • Apart from supporting functions, intelligent machines can be designed with life-saving capabilities as well, for
    example, robots used in medical diagnostics and inspection robots. These must be designed with high accuracy to
    avoid any accidents and to have the best results.

    Robots and robotics
    Robots: A robot is an intensive, influential machine. Automotive control is used to guide a robot. The main
    objective of the robots is to assist the world in daily routines. The actions that a robot can perform comprises of
    picking the objects, moving, and destroying them, and modify them as directed [4].

    Robot operating system: The robot operating system is a unique, comprehensive and opensource operating system that
    is developed to control the robots. This system functions the same as the computer operating system. Functions of a
    robot operating system are:

    • Management of the hardware components, processes, and memory.

    • Management of the data merging, concurrency, and parallelism.

    The extensive use of AI and provision of hidden reasoning algorithms [5].

    Robotics: Robotics is a branch of AI [6]. The mechanical construction is the property of the robots, which is used
    to form or design a particular task. The power and control of machinery are handled by the electrical components
    present in the robots. What, when, and how a robot performs a task is controlled by the computer program built in
    the robot.

    History of robots and robotics: Telemanipulators are machines that are controlled remotely and have an arm and a
    gripper. Humans use a control device to give instructions to telemanipulators. The main objective of the
    telemanipulators is to provide successful collaboration with the radioactive material. Numerical control provides
    the facility to control the machine accurately. In 1952 for the first time, numeric control was used by MIT.
    Numerical control caused the development of the APT (Automated, programmed tools). In 1961 the first industrial
    robot was developed using these techniques. Those robots were used in industrial jobs such as car construction
    plants. The desire for autonomous transport systems leads to the development of autonomous robots. Since 1975 the
    humanoid robots are being developed. MIT-AI-Lab has been developing humanoid robots named ‘Cog’ since 1994. Robots
    are the best friends of humans in science fiction. However, soon we will see the roles taking the jobs as universal
    programmable machine slaves [4].

    Ai and robotics: Artificial intelligence is a vast field that is also pushing its way in the domain of healthcare
    [7], business [8] and social sector [9]. The concept of AI and robotics is based on an agent called an ‘actor’. An
    actor is considered a software component, and it has a unique assembly of the hardware structure of the robot. The
    unique link between actor and physical structure of the robot enables the control of the robot through the actor.
    The software component uses sensors to read the data. After completing the reading process, the robot decides to
    take the next action and give directions to its effectors to act physically in the environment [6]. AI-Robotics
    intersection covers the following concerns:

    • Actions that are planned, including the monitoring and the reasons behind the goal.

    • Through open environments, we have modelling, understanding, and picking.

    • Developing interaction with humans as well as other robots.

    • Learning models that are required by the functions.

    And combining those functions to develop a flexible and durable architecture [4].

    Analysis of different robots: Gradually different types of robots have been invented. In Table I, we have provided a
    comparative study of various types of robots.
