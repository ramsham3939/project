    <h1 style="text-align:center">Web Applications</h1>
    <br><br>
    Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites. It involves a wide range of tasks,
    including designing and building the front-end and back-end of a website, creating and implementing a
    website's content, and ensuring that a website is functional, user-friendly, and secure.

    Web developers use a variety of programming languages and technologies to create and maintain websites. Some
    of the most common programming languages used in web development include HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS
    (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript. These languages are used to create the structure, style, and
    interactivity of a website.

    Web developers may also use server-side languages such as PHP (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) and Ruby on Rails
    to build the back-end of a website, which is responsible for storing and organizing data, and processing user
    requests.

    In addition to programming languages, web developers may also use a variety of tools and frameworks to help
    them build and maintain websites. These tools can range from simple text editors, to more complex integrated
    development environments (IDEs), to content management systems (CMS) that allow non-technical users to manage
    a website's content.

    Web development is a constantly evolving field, as new technologies and best practices emerge. As such, web
    developers must be willing to continuously learn and adapt to keep up with the latest trends and techniques.

    Web development is a crucial part of the modern internet, as it enables businesses, organizations, and
    individuals to share information and interact with a global audience. It is an exciting and dynamic field that
    offers a wide range of career opportunities for those with the right skills and passion.
    <br><br>
    "Learning HTML and CSS is a lot more challenging than it used to be. Responsive web design adds more layers of
    complexity to design and develop websites. "

    This program covers UI Design (HTML|CSS| Javascripts | Jquery), PHP development for the web, quick to learn, easy to
    deploy and provides substantial functionality required for ecommerce along with Database MYSQL. Perform hands-on
    practice with database to create databasedriven HTML forms and reports.

    WHY WEB DEVELOPMENT IS IMPORTANT?

    A well-designed website is essential for reaching a larger audience and generating more leads or customers. Using a
    website, you can collect and read testimonials about your products and services much more quickly and easily. Web
    development and design help to promote a company's brand name.

    Web Development can be classified into two ways:

    Front-end Development

    APP USED FOR WEB DEVELOPMENT VS CODE (VISUAL STDIO CODE ):

    Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task
    running, and version control. It aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug cycle
    and leaves more complex workflows to fuller featured IDEs, such as Visual Studio IDE.

    In every Software web application development User interface designing and development play major role. User
    Interaction happen to UI as soon as open webpage. The user interface will be combination of HTML4,5, CSS2,3,
    Javascript, Jquery, Angular, XML Parsing, JSON Parsion, API Web services. Learn all the skills, tools, and processes
    you need to become a UI designe
    <br><br>
    HTML and the DOM
    HTML and DOM viewer and editor is commonly included in the built-in web development tools. The difference between
    the HTML and DOM viewer, and the view source feature in web browsers is that the HTML and DOM viewer allows you to
    see the DOM as it was rendered in addition to allowing you to make changes to the HTML and DOM and see the change
    reflected in the page after the change is made.

    In addition to selecting and editing, the HTML elements panels will usually also display properties of the DOM
    object, such as display dimension, and Cascading- style sheet properties.


    3D page inspector, a feature of Firefox versions 11 to 46.
    Firefox versions 11 to 46 were equipped with a 3D page inspector using WebGL, where the nesting of elements was
    visualized with layers protruding from the page surface.

    Web page assets, resources and network information
    Web pages typically load and require additional content in the form of images, scripts, font and other external
    files. Web development tools also allow developers to inspect resources that are loaded and available on the web
    page in a tree-structure listing, and the appearance of style sheets can be tested in real time.

    Web development tools also allow developers to view information about the network usage, such as viewing what the
    loading time and bandwidth usage are and which HTTP headers are being sent and received.

    Profiling and auditing
    Profiling allows developers to capture information about the performance of a web page or web application. With this
    information developers can improve the performance of their scripts. Auditing features may provide developers
    suggestions, after analyzing a page, for optimizations to decrease page load time and increase responsiveness. Web
    development tools typically also provide a record of the time it takes to render the page, memory usage, and the
    types of events which are taking place.

    These features allow developers to optimize their web page or web application.

    JavaScript debugging
    JavaScript is commonly used in web browsers. Web development tools commonly include a panel to debug scripts by
    allowing developers to add watch expressions, breakpoints, view the call stack, and pause, step over, step into, and
    step out of functions while debugging JavaScript.

    A JavaScript console is commonly included. The consoles allow developers to type in JavaScript commands and call
    functions, or view errors that may have been encountered during the execution of a script.
