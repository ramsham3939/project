          <br><br>
          2. Front-end development: Web developers are skilled in coding and programming languages like HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript, which are used to create the visual and interactive elements of a website. A good web developer

            take advantage of the device's hardware and features.
            <br><br>
            3. Cross-platform development: In addition to native app development, some mobile app developers also offer
